# The Virtual World

### Overview
This project is part of my learning journey where I am following along with a tutorial by Radu Mariescu-Istodor on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel. The tutorial offers a comprehensive guide that intertwines mathematics, algorithms, programming, and design principles. It's been an invaluable resource in enhancing my understanding and skills in these areas.

##### Tutorial Details
Instructor: Radu Mariescu-Istodor  
Platform: freeCodeCamp (YouTube)  
Link to Tutorial: [Build a Virtual World Filled with Self-Driving Cars â€“ JavaScript Tutorial](https://youtu.be/5iHejdqYIa8?si=btwwJmXQxvd-W1SF)  

### Class Diagram
I have included a class diagram, [published here](https://lucid.app/documents/view/527d6eba-f358-47e6-89bb-2ccb0ff84fd4), to aid in understanding the code's architecture and flow. The diagram helps visualize the structure of the classes, their attributes, methods, and the interactions between them. Note: This is an in-progress, I update the diagram as I follow along the tutorial. 

### Learning Outcomes
Through this tutorial, I am gaining a deeper understanding of:

1. Fundamental and Intermediate programming concepts.
2. Application of algorithms in solving complex problems.
3. Integration of mathematical concepts in programming.

Feel free to explore the repository and the resources. Any feedback or contributions are highly appreciated!
